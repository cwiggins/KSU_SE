This is a simple file organizer. It is going to keep keep of a user's
documents, music, videos, and other stuff the user deems important to keep
track of. It should be able to organize all the files in multitude of ways.
One way maybe to first organize them by extension some that way all the txt
files are viewable when asked for and so forth. Should be able to set permission
so only those other people the user wants to access the file can access them.

Should also be able to do a search for a document/music/video by name or by any
other identifying information. The program should also tell the user a list of
other people that have accessed the file since it was created and if they have
made any modifications it to.
